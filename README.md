# iRNanoFlags

Use your Nanoleafs with iRacing! 

## Config

Define your nanoleaf effects, ip and duration for effects in .ini file 

## Pairing

On first start, you need to put your Nanoleaf ito pairing mode by holding the power button for around 5 seconds till the 
led start to flash. When you start irnanoflags now, it will create a file in your home directory, which contains the api 
key from pairing. irnanoflags uses that file on startup, so no new pairing is needed.

## Effects
Make sure, you have created your preferred effects and added these to the irnanoflags.ini

## Installation
Run the Installer, which will create a folder on your Desktop, if you don't change it, and puts both needed files inside.
